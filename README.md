# Facial recognition

Facial recognition is a technique for recognizing or verifying a person’s identification by looking at their face. This technology can recognize persons in photographs, videos, and in real-time. A type of biometric security is facial recognition. Although there is growing interest in other applications, the technology is mostly employed for security and law enforcement. Typically, face recognition does not need a large database of images to identify an individual’s identification; rather, it merely identifies and recognizes one person as the device’s only owner, while restricting access to others.

## How does face recognition work?

### 1) Detection
Detection is the process of finding a face in an image. Enabled by computer vision, facial recognition can detect and identify individual faces from an image containing one or many people's faces. It can detect facial data in both front and side face profiles

### 2) Analysis
The facial recognition system then analyzes the image of the face. It maps and reads face geometry and facial expressions. It identifies facial landmarks that are key to distinguishing a face from other objects. The facial recognition technology typically 
- Distance between the eyes
- Distance from the forehead to the chin
- Distance between the nose and mouth
- Depth of the eye sockets
- Shape of the cheekbones
- Contour of the lips, ears, and chin

### 3) Recognition
Facial recognition can identify a person by comparing the faces in two or more images and assessing the likelihood of a face match. For example, it can verify that the face shown in a selfie taken by a mobile camera matches the face in an image of a government-issued ID like a driver's license or passport, as well as verify that the face shown in the selfie does not match a face in a collection of faces previously captured.
